# Xinghan Canlan 1v1 Mode

`xinghan_canlan` is a FreeKill/New Moon Kill extension for a competitive 1v1 mode. It provides the mode logic, rule skills, QML selection dialogs, English translations, and a dedicated 108-card deck.

## Features

- Two-player 1v1 mode.
- Seat 1 is the lord and first player; seat 2 is the renegade and second player.
- Opens with 18 generals, then bans in this order: second player 1, first player 2, second player 1.
- Drafts generals in this order: second 1, first 2, second 2, first 2, second 2, first 2, second 2, first receives the final remaining general.
- Each player builds a 7-general pool.
- Each round allows 1 or 2 deployed generals.
- Winning generals are locked; losing generals return to their owner's pool.
- First player to win 3 rounds wins the match.
- Dedicated 108-card deck.
- Ao Zhan rules: after the second deck shuffle, Peach can answer Analeptic/Wine requests; after the third shuffle, the current turn player loses 1 HP at turn end.
- Selection dialogs use responsive QML layouts with adaptive grid columns.
